Simple [AutoSplitter](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters/) script used by [LiveSplit](https://livesplit.org/) to time runs in [Meet Your Maker](https://meetyourmakergame.com/).

The script is designed for timing single-level runs, and expects exactly two splits to be configured (one split upon grabbing the Genmat, and the final one when reaching the escape).

It gives a very close estimate (off by a couple of frames) of the time that would be used on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/meet_your_maker/) with the current official timing rules (based on video capture).
